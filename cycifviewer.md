  Visualizing and sharing CyCIF images
</h2>
<p class="">
For a ~10 x 11mm tissue FFPE specimen under 20X objective, each cycle of t-CyCIF generates around 160 individual image tiles. The assembly process involves stitching sequential image tiles from a single t-CyCIF cycle into one large image panel, flat-fielding to correct for uneven illumination and registration of images from successive t-CyCIF cycles
to each other; these procedures were performed using <a href="https://fiji.sc/" target="_blank">ImageJ</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sorgerlab/ashlar" target="_blank">ASHLAR</a>, and  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14836" target="_blank">BaSiC software</a>.

<p class="">
The stitched images are stored on  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a> and the zoomable image viewer
implemented using  <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSeaDragon</a>.

          Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescent microscopy (t-CyCIF) is a simple method for generating highly multiplexed optical images from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples routinely used for histopathological diagnosis of human disease. The method is based on previously described single-cell imaging approaches and readily implemented on existing instruments (Gerdes et al. 2013, Lin et al. 2015, 2016).
