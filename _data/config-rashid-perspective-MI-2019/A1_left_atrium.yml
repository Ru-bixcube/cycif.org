      Description: |
        The epicardial (on the surface) adipose tissue is readily apparent in this section 
        of the left atrium (normal).  In close proximity to the arteries and veins is intramyocardial 
        adipose tissue which is also a normal feature. 
        
        At low magnification, the bundles of myocytes can be readily observed in a pattern that appears 
        disorganized and disarrayed (another normal feature) separated by fibrous bands or fibrovascular 
        and adipose tissue. 
        
        While the cardiac myocytes appear to comprise the vast majority of the heart tissue, they 
        represent only approximately one-quarter of the cells, with the complement of cells comprising 
        fibroblasts, adipocytes, immune cells, neuroendocrine cells (atrial naturetic peptide or 
        factor producing) and cells of the vasculature. 
        
        Between the myocytes is interstitial connective tissue which can increase in the setting of 
        hypertension and volume overload. Generally, the wall of the left atrium is ~3-4mm in thickness. 
        The endocardial layer of the left atrium is generally thick with the collagen deposited by 
        scattered fibroblasts partly in response to the pressure of blood entering from the pulmonary veins.

      Description: |
        This area contains an artery, a vein, and a nerve.
        
        The artery and vein are filled with red blood cells and both are lined by endothelial cells (tunica intima). 
        
        The artery has a thick muscular wall (tunica media) whereas the vein has a thin muscular wall. 
        
        The adjacent nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides parasympathetic innervation of 
        the heart and innervates the sinoatrial node.

      Description: |
        In this high- magnification view of the left atrium, individual myocytes are seen, each 
        contributing to functional syncytium. 
        
        The cross striations of myocytes are readily evident with regularly and equally spaced 
        alternating dark and light lines. 
        
        The nuclei of myocytes are generally placed in the middle of the myocyte and are 
        generally ovoid, often with prominent nucleoli. While cardiac myocytes are terminally 
        differentiated, they are transcriptionally active, generating the mRNA 
        transcripts required for maintaining the sarcomere function, mitochondria and other essential 
        requirements. 
        
        Between the myocytes is a dense network of capillaries and occasional larger vascular structures 
        such as this post-capillary venule. 
        
        Adjacent to the nuclei within the myocytes, are yellow brown colored 
        dots which are lysosomes containing lipids damaged by peroxidation and oxidative stress. 
        These structures are referred to as lipofuscin (thought of as a marker of ‘wear and tear’).
