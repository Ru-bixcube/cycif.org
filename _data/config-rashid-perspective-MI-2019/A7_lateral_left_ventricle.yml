        In this view of the lateral left ventricle wall, epicardial fat is seen on one 
        side of the section and papillary muscles present on the opposite side which 
        is the left ventricle lumen.

    - Name: Papillary Muscle
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        In the center of one of the papillary muscles is a region of acute ischemia 
        with mildly increased eosinophilia (approximately 12-24 hours). 
        
        Peripherally, there is a layer of 5-8 myocytes that are viable but vacuolated. 
        These myocytes are alive because of their proximity to the ventricular lumen 
        where the blood pumping through the heart provides for the metabolic needs so 
        as to prevent infarction and death of those peripherally located cells. 
        
        Often, when there is infarction of the papillary muscles of the left ventricle 
        which anchor the mitral valve leaflets via the chordae tendineae, there is 
        mitral valve dysfunction and prominent regurgitation that can result in rapid 
        back flow of blood down the low hemodynamic pressure of the left atrium, and 
        the left veins into the lung. The result is flash pulmonary edema with a rapid 
        accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and emergent respiratory distress.
