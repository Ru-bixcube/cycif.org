      Description: |
        This region of the left posterior left ventricular wall has examples of 
        both acute (1-2 days) and subacute (1-2 weeks) myocardial infarction.
        
        At low magnification, a region of pallor is seen in one of the trabeculations 
        of the posterior left ventricular wall.

    - Name: Granulation Tissue
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        At high magnification, loosely arranged collagen and abundant capillaries can be 
        seen in a region that is characterized as granulation tissue. This is a pattern 
        of healing that occurs one to two weeks after a myocardial infarction. 
        
        Within this highly vascularized tissue are scattered viable myocytes with 
        vacuolization of the cytoplasm suggestive of stunned myocardium with aberrant 
        ionic regulation and water accumulation. 
        
        Also interspersed are scattered macrophages with hemosiderin pigment 
        suggestive of prior hemorrhage. 
        
        Ultimately the granulation will undergo replacement fibrosis to produce a 
        long-term scar (after six weeks).

    - Name: Coagulative Necrosis
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        A high magnification view of the myocardial wall shows a region with hypereosinophilic 
        and thinned myocytes starting to undergo coagulative necrosis. 
        
        Numerous neutrophils fill the interstitial space between the myocytes. 
        
        Acute inflammation is a feature that is characteristic of an acute myocardial 
        infarction (approximately 1-2 days).
