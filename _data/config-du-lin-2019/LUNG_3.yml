        In this tissue specimen of a human lung cancer, the tumor region can be seen on the right-hand side and an 
        adjacent non-tumor, stromal region can be seen on the left-hand side.

        The tumor-stromal interface runs diagonal along this image. 
        The tumor-stromal interface undergoes changes in cancer that can provide clues
        to tumor metastasis and progression.

        The epithelial tumor cells of the lung are denoted by their cytoplasmic expression of `Keratin`. 
        Clusters of tumor cells are associated with stromal areas containing fibroblasts (`α-SMA`) 
        and immune cells (`CD45` and `IBA1`).

      Description: |
        When single cells are clustered based on their expression of `Keratin`, `a-SMA`, and `CD45` 
        using the k-means algorithm, the cells fall into four cardinal clusters `:` 
        1) A cluster of tumor cells with high keratin expression, 
        2) a cluster of stromal cells with high `a-SMA` expression, 
        3) a cluster of immune cells with high `CD45` expression, and 
        4) a cluster of cells with low expression of all three markers.

      Description: |
        Programmed Death Ligand 1 (`PD-L1`), also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274), 
        is a target of immunotherapeutics. It is expressed in tumor cells (`Keratin`) 
        as well as in some macrophages (`IBA1`). `PD-L1` inactivates T-cells 
        and prevents immune surveillance of the tumors by binding to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells. 
        Thus, one approach to immunotherapy is to block `PD-L1` expression.

      Description: |
        In this tumor, we found a rare, or low frequency, immune population`:` CD8+/FOXP3+ T cells. 
        
        Traditionally, expression of `FOXP3` has been observed in `CD4` expressing cells,
        indicating a regulatory T cell phenotype. However, single-cell analysis of multiple markers 
        revealed a population of `CD8` expressing cells that also expresses `FOXP3`. 
        
        The frequency of this population is very low (0.66% of immune cells) in this lung tumor. 
        
        This rare population of `CD8` and `FOXP3` expressing cells in addition to the more characterized 
        population of `CD4` and `FOXP3` expressing cells are both enriched in the tumor region.

      Description: |
        Another rare, or low frequency, population present in the tumor 
        is `PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ double positive T cells. Both of these markers are
        immune checkpoint receptors expressed on T cells and are therefore 
        targets of immunotherapies.

        Some of these `PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ double positive cells express `CD4` 
        whereas others express `CD8`.

        The frequency of these populations is very low. `CD8`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ 
        cells comprise only 1% of immune cells whereas `CD4`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ 
        cells comprise an even smaller proportion, ~0.1% of immune cells.

        Both populations are enriched in the tumor region, with `CD8`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`++ cells
        having a 14-fold greater abundance in the tumor region versus the stromal region
        and `CD4`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ cells being present exclusively in the tumor region.
